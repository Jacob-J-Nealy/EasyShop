# üõçÔ∏è EasyShop E-Commerce API

An enterprise-level RESTful web application that enables users to browse products, manage profiles, and interact with a persistent shopping cart system. Built using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

## üßæ About the Project

**EasyShop** is a fully functional back-end for an e-commerce platform where users can register, log in, browse a dynamic product catalog, maintain shopping cart items, and manage profile details. This project simulates the server-side logic for an online store and applies key object-oriented design principles, layered architecture, and security via JWT authentication.

Originally, users could only view products. But as features expanded across four major phases, customers can now register securely, maintain profiles, add items to their cart, and modify their orders seamlessly‚Äîall while preserving data across sessions.

## üí° Challenges & Reflections

Developing EasyShop was a true test of my ability to write scalable, maintainable code across multiple layers‚Äîespecially under time pressure and changing requirements. I worked through:

- Customizing SQL queries with nullable filters
- Integrating full user authentication with token management
- Handling cart persistence at the DAO level
- Building DAO classes and controllers from scratch

Despite bugs and setbacks, I stayed the course. I leaned heavily on Object-Oriented Programming and REST principles, and I grew tremendously in the process. EasyShop reflects not just code, but **resilience and personal growth**.
